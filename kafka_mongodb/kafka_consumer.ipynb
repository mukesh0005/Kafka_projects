In the opening montage in TDK we see that criminals are deterred by the bat signal, and in TDKR we see how Batman was perceived as a folk hero figure by characters like the orphans and even police officers.

I love Nolan\\\\u2019s trilogy in its entirety. I frequently alternate between Begins and TDK as my favourite.

In the opening montage in TDK we see that criminals are deterred by the bat signal, and in TDKR we see how Batman was perceived as a folk hero figure by characters like the orphans and even police officers.
